# SENEMOS Nabu mainline kernel

This COPR source follows kernel.org's newest `stable` release and publishes it as
`senemos-nabu-kernel-mainline` with a conventional Fedora release number. The source
contains its own checksum-locked device patch series, distinct ABI and SENEMOS7
maintenance family. `update-upstream.sh` accepts a new stable version only after
the complete Nabu patch and configuration gate passes. The accepted commit then
triggers the COPR SCM package's automatic rebuild; a failed port leaves the last
working repository result untouched.
